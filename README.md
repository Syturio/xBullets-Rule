### Description
> A simple plugin for CounterStrike 1.6 server. This plugin is mainly for Surf Mod servers, it makes players only able to to shoot X bullets of AWP every Xsecs./spot. The main porpuse of that rule is to make players move/surf more, and stay less time camping with AWP. It forces AWP to have X ammo (3 by default), once the player shoots the X bullets, he will have to wait X seconds (15 by default) before he can shoot them again. Also, the refresh time starts at the first bullet, wich means your ammo still gets refreshed even if you only used 1 bullet.

### Cvars
> • amx_time_xbullets - The amount of time player has to wait before he gets new ammo. (15 seconds by default)
> 
> • amx_ammo_xbullets - The amount bullets player gets on AWP. (3 bullets by default)
